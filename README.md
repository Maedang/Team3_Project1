# Team 3 (Project 1): Data Science Career Analysis

As data science students, many of us are interested in transitioning into a career in data science or furthering our current careers in data science. Our topic explores the demographics of careers in data science at both entry and senior levels. We utilized several datasets to help us answer eight questions that provide valuable insights into the field of data science and benefit our class as a whole.

Q1: How does a data scientist's experience level impact their salary?

As expected, this graph shows us that a data scientist’s salary increases as they progress from entry level to executive level positions. Interestingly, the salaries for each level have remained relatively similar over the past three years. The greatest variation is at the executive level where we can see that the average salary for executives decreased considerably from 2021 to 2022. Overall, this data implies that there is room for growth in salary as a data scientist. Entry level data scientists can expect to earn around $60,000 annually, while senior level data scientists can anticipate earnings of nearly $150,000 annually.      

Q2: Is remote work more rewarding for entry level or senior level data scientists?

These graphs directly compare the salary and experience level of a sample group of data scientists for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. The colors indicate whether the position is remote, hybrid, or in-person. Green represents a remote job, while orange represents a hybrid role, and blue indicates that the position is in-person. Based on the data, it appears that remote work has been more lucrative for both entry level and senior level data scientists over the past two years. This trend could be due to the increase in remote positions since the start of the pandemic in 2020.  

Q3: What is the most commonly used programming language for data science?

Our dataset contains a sample of over 10,000 data scientists that participated in a survey that asked them which programming languages they use the most. This pie chart shows how prevalent Python is used amongst data scientists. 8,744 data scientists (78.3%) said that they use Python the most, while 1,465 (13.1%) claimed R is their most used programming language. This data implies that knowledge and expertise of Python is in high demand, and we should continue to improve our skills in Python to make ourselves more marketable as data scientists.

Q4: Which states have the most demand for data scientists?

This chart of the United States shows us which states have the most demand for data scientists. The conditional formatting depicts the total number of workers by color. The scale indicates that darker greens represent more workers, while lighter greens represent less workers. This chart makes it easy to identify California as the state with most demand for data scientists with nearly 23,000 workers in data science roles. Washington has the second highest demand with approximately 15,000 data scientists. Other notable states to consider are New York and Texas with approximately 10,000 and 5,000 total workers respectively. By identifying the states with the most opportunities in data science, people seeking entry level positions or considering a transition to a different position in data science can use this information to aid them in their search. 

Q5: Which locations have the highest salaries for data scientists?

This heat map depicts the states with the highest salaries for data scientists in the United States. The cost of living is notoriously high in areas such as California and New York, so it makes sense that they would have high salaries; however, there are many states that have similar salaries and a much lower cost of living. This ratio is important to consider when searching for a role a data science. Interestingly, Washington has the second highest number of data scientists in the country; however, they earn less money than data scientists in most other states. 

Q6: What is the percentage of males and females with careers in data science?

This chart gives shows us the gender demographics of data scientists. The dataset that we used for this question consists of 10,971 data scientists that participated in a survey. 9,562 (87.2%) identified as male, while 1,397 (12.7%) identified as female, and 12 (.1%) identified as nonbinary. This sample implies that the majority of data scientists are male.  

Q7: How does education impact the salary of a data scientist?

This bar chart shows how education impacts a data scientist’s salary. The dataset that we used for this question consists of 10,971 data scientists that participated in a survey. Interestingly, the survey found that people without a college degree earned more money than people with a bachelor’s or even master’s degree. These results imply that experience is considered more valuable than formal education in the data science field.   

Q8: What are the highest paying positions in data science?

These are many roles in data science, so we wanted to find the top ten highest paying positions by job title and starting salary. The dataset that we used for this question consists of 10,971 data scientists that participated in a survey. In the previous questions, we determined that the average starting salary for an entry level data analyst is approximately $60,000 annually. This list includes two titles that have similar pay: Business Analyst and Data Analyst. These would be good roles to search for entry level applicants. Product/Project Manager is the highest on this list potentially starting at $90,000+. This would be a good role for an experienced data science professional to consider.
